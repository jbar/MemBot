## MemBot

One day this tools should be able to read and execute directly xml
files (\*.ct) written for the Cheat Engine application (which run only
on windowsÂ®).

Today ct scripts should be rewritten to be used.

__Note:__

This tool use scanmem as a backend, and so require it to run.
Tested with scanmem v0.12.
